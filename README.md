PageDown-Bootstrap-i18n
=======================

This is a fork of https://github.com/samwillis/pagedown-bootstrap to add i18n support

Currently the tooltips on editor toolbar and all the content on image/link insertion modal are supporting i18n, just simply add a file similar to i18n/Markdown.i18n.zh_CN.js
, it should work fine.

The solution of adding i18n support is inspired by https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker, :)

The demo is viewable here: http://samwillis.co.uk/pagedown-bootstrap/demo/browser/demo.html

New icons based on http://glyphicons.com/, http://dribbble.com/shots/365544-Mini-glyphs-12-px-Free-PSD and the origional icons.
